Exercise: Set up the app

Overview      
Before you proceed with retrieving and manipulating data, you’ll want to make sure it has some place to go! In this exercise, you’ll create a Menu page for the Little Lemon app, which is where the data will be displayed.

Scenario        
The dishes offered by Little Lemon, as well as their prices, change constantly. It would be a hassle for you as a developer to manually update the information in the mobile app each time it happens. Fortunately, you can skip this step and set up the app to fetch current data directly from the server each time it is opened.

Furthermore, you can enable customers to filter the data to display menu items by category. Let’s start by establishing the core structure of the app to make this possible.

Instructions      
Step 1 – Set up the project
The starter code for this project can be found in this zipped folder:

Step 2 – Verify the setup              
In your project, run the application in the iOS or Android emulator. The screen that appears should contain the following elements: 

A search bar in which users can type a query and filter by the name of the menu item. 

A collection of category filters that you can select or unselect. 

A sample menu list stored in memory, with a collection of dishes grouped by category, where each menu item displays a title and its price in dollars.

Observe the screenshot below for an example of how the screen should appear in iOS:

Conclusion      
By completing this exercise, you now have a React Native app page that is ready to be populated with data. You’ll make this happen across the following exercises.
